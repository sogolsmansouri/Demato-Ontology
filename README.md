# Demato-Ontology
Blockchains are distributed ledger platforms that were originally envisioned for implementing digital assets and cryptocurrencies
such as Bitcoin. Mainstream blockchain platforms such as Ethereum
and Hyperledger support both ”native” transactional behavior i.e.,
transferring cryptocurrency assets, as well as, other types of transactional behavior relevant to an emerging class of applications called decentralized applications or DApps. However, ”non-native” transactional
behavior is achieved in terms of user-defined programs, commonly referred to as smart contracts. Unfortunately, smart contracts have several
known limitations including, the burden on both implementor and contract consumers, being prone to financially-costly errors, higher cost of
execution and overall difficulty with concurrency optimization. Further,
there is a lack of standardization with respect to implementation. Consequently, this contributes to the difficulty of enabling interoperability
across blockchains.
In this paper, we propose an ontology DeMaTO for modeling transactional behavior on blockchains as a foundation for extending blockchain
transaction primitives. As an application context, we focus on marketplace transactions because marketplaces are one of the most popular
categories of DApps, i.e., decentralized marketplaces. This modeling of
transactional behavior complements the modeling supported by existing ontologies that focus on the infrastructure layer. We illustrate how
DeMaTO can be used in blockchain transaction modeling and its value
with respect to blockchain queryability and transaction validation.
We plan to make it available using open source license, such as GNU.
